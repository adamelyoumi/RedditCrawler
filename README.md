# RedditCrawler
A simple Selenium-based Reddit crawler/upvoter.

An attempt was made to update posts from a list of target accounts with a list of upvoting accounts.
User agent randomization and Tor proxy are among the attempts made, but Reddit doesn't register them, because it probably detects the common source as suspicious/coming from the same person.

# Usage

Refer to "installation.txt" (all in french)
